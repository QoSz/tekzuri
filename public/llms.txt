# TekZuri

> TekZuri is a web development agency that crafts elegant, performant digital experiences using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. Inspired by the Japanese philosophy of monozukuri (ものづくり), we bring meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail to every project we build.

TekZuri combines technical expertise with creative thinking to deliver solutions that exceed expectations and stand the test of time. Based in Nairobi, Kenya with international reach, we serve clients seeking strategic digital presence through custom web applications, mobile solutions, and IT consulting.
